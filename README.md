# Customer Segmentation:

## Motivation:
This project is designed to give a hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and work towards developing conclusions for a potential client on a real-world dataset. Many companies today collect vast amounts of data on customers and clientele, and have a strong desire to understand the meaningful relationships hidden in their customer base. Being equipped with this information can assist a company with future products and services that best satisfy the demands or needs of their customers.

## Project Overview:
In this project I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 
first, I explored the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I did preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, then I have applied PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I trained the segmentation model to find an hidden pattrens and consider ways of this information that will assist the wholesale distributor for future service changes.

## Dataset:
